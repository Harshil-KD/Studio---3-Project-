15/02/2024 summary: 
We did the brainstorm and discussed about the system idea of our project and types of Users in the our finance management system.

There are 4 types of User in our case:
Admins: Responsible for overseeing the entire Finance management system, admins have administrative privileges. They can manage user accounts, view all expenses and incomes, and handle system management tasks.

Registered Users: Individuals who have created accounts on the system. They can manage their personal financial data, including expenses and incomes. Registered users have access to features such as profile management, expense entry, income entry, and a personalized dashboard.

Premium Users: A subset of registered users with additional privileges or features. Premium users may have access to exclusive tools, advanced analytics, or premium features that enhance their financial management experience.

Guests: Individuals with limited access to the system. Guests can view a simplified overview screen with basic financial information without the need to register. However, their access is restricted compared to registered users.

Next Steps: 
Use-Cases for our Finance Management System.
Discuss with Tariq about Database.
