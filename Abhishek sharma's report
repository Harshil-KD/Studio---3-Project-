Today i have done research on unfunctional requirements for the users of moneywise app .
where i realised that these things needt to be int the for making this app user friendly
these are the following requirements
Performance:

 

Response Time: The app should have low latency, providing quick responses to user inputs.
Throughput: It should be capable of handling a certain number of transactions or data inputs per unit of time.
Scalability: The app should be scalable to accommodate an increasing number of users and data over time.
Reliability:

 

Availability: The app should be available for use during specified time frames without significant downtime.
Fault Tolerance: The app should be resilient to system failures, ensuring data integrity and minimizing data loss.
Security:

 

Authentication and Authorization: Ensure secure login mechanisms and proper authorization levels for users.
Data Encryption: Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest to protect user information.
Secure Transactions: Ensure the security of financial transactions and sensitive data.
Usability:

 

User Interface (UI) Design: The app should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Accessibility: Ensure that the app is accessible to users with disabilities.
Consistency: Maintain a consistent look and feel across different platforms and devices.
Scalability:

 

Database Scalability: The app's database should be scalable to handle an increasing volume of financial data.
User Scalability: The app should be able to handle a growing user base without significant degradation in performance.
Maintainability:
